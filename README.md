# Plotting Code
Feel free to use this however you like
most code can be run from the commandline as is, feel free to edit and change things as you see fit.
All code represented here is the most basic version of the code I use to generate my own figures.

Any code with a fun name (ImmortanJo) was developed for a specific analysis and is included here in case someone wants to play around with it.

Have fun, be safe
